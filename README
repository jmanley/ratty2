install is standard:
  python setup.py install

Most parameters are hard-coded in cam.py. Modify here if you've changed the system in any way.
Calibration is stored in cal.py

  * run rfi_init BEFORE doing anything else.
  * If you reinit, then you must restart any graphs or captures (else scaling and timestamps will be wrong).
  * Plotted spectrum is not accurate (scales are wrong) -- only an indication. This is because we collapse (crudely!) the number of channels for plotting by simply summing adjacent channels. The annotations are accurate.
  * Antenna calibration files should be comma separated values with at least two columns, headed 'freq_hz' and 'gain_dbi' with the appropriate values. Do not include any other header information. Some examples are included, however, please check https://github.com/ska-sa/rfi_ant_cal for the latest cal files.

Rev 0.0.7   Bugfix to rfi_spectrum.py with fft_scale/fft_shift when reading back files,
            New bitstream using new snap blocks
Rev 0.0.6 new calibration scheme (closer to corr)
Rev 0.0.5 now with ability to play back datafiles

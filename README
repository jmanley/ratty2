ReAlTime Transient analYser control package.

install is standard:
  python setup.py install

  * run rfi_init.py BEFORE doing anything else.
  * If you reinit, then you must restart any graphs or captures that were running (else scaling and timestamps will be wrong).
  * Antenna calibration files should be comma separated values with at least two columns, headed 'freq_hz' and 'gain_dbi' with the appropriate values. Do not include any other header information.

Rev 0.1.0   Shuffled stuff around quite a lot to make more object oriented.             
            Configuration files now live in /etc/ratty1/. A sample is provided in cal_files.
            rfi_time seems to have something wrong with the trigger points.
            rfi_time now performs csv export with optional histogram plotting (replaces three separate scripts)

Rev 0.0.8   Altered code to use configuration file at src/system_parameters.

Rev 0.0.7   Bugfix to rfi_spectrum.py with fft_scale/fft_shift when reading back files,
            New bitstream using new snap blocks
Rev 0.0.6 new calibration scheme (closer to corr)
Rev 0.0.5 now with ability to play back datafiles
